		<p>Or alternatively if you would like to make a small donation there will be a box on entry to the venue.  This would be used towards anything on the list that isn’t bought and towards our honeymoon in the Peak District.</p>

		<p>There is parking at the venue.</p>
		<p>We would like to have an unplugged ceremony so that everyone can be fully present. Our photographer and videographer will capture the moment, so please save the photos/videos for after.</p>
